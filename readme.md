This is a simple service for retrieving/interacting with the [4k world map data](http://4kworldmap.com/). The data exclusively belongs to 4k world map project.

# Get started

You must have Docker installed. If you are using Docker for Mac, make sure to share the repo directory.

To develop the application run `./start.dev`

# Managing the Data

To simplify the data before publishing we import and restructure it from the individual regions and maps to flat files. To extract the data run:

```
node ./data/importer.js
```
